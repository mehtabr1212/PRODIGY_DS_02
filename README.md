# Titanic Dataset Analysis
Welcome to the Titanic Dataset Analysis repository! This project aims to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information from the infamous Titanic disaster. By examining various factors such as age, gender, passenger class, and more, we aim to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival outcomes.

## About the Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of the following columns:

- PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- Name: Passenger's name
- Sex: Passenger's gender
- Age: Passenger's age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

## Project Structure
